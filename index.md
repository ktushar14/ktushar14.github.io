title: About Me
---

I am a robotics researcher and engineer, currently an applied scientist at [The AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com).

Previously, I
- earned a Master of Science degree in Robotics from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)'s [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/),
- worked as a research engineer in the [Search-Based Planning Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/),
- was an undergraduate intern in the [Robot Perception Lab](https://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/"),
- and earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/).

<!-- I am an Applied Scientist at the [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com), generally interested in sequential decision making and its applications to robotics. -->
<!-- Prior to this, I earned a master's degree from [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/)'s [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I worked in the [Search-Based Planning Lab (SBPL)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) and was advised by [Maxim Likhachev](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/) and [Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/). -->
<!-- While my masterâ€™s thesis addressed search-based planning for robots performing sensor-based coverage, my other works included novel algorithms for probabilistic planning, multi-resolution heuristic search, and multi-agent pathfinding. -->
<!-- Before starting the master's program at CMU, I worked as a research engineer at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/">SBPL</a> with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/">Maxim Likhachev</a>, during which time I also closely collaborated with <a href="https://orensalzman.com/">Oren Salzman</a>. Even before that, I earned an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/">BITS Pilani</a> in Goa, India. In my final year, I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/">Michael Kaess</a> in the <a href="https://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/">Robot Perception Lab (RPL)</a> at CMU on improving loop-closures for underwater SLAM&mdash;this doubled as my undergraduate thesis. -->
